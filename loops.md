# Control Flow in JavaScript

## for/of Loop
This Loop will execute one time for however many items there are in the collection you run it on. Example:

```
for (item of collection) {
  // run function on an individual item
}
```


## While Loop
This loop will execute forever while the passed condition is true. It will stop when the condition becomes false.

```

  while (condition == true) {
     // do this
  }
```

## If statement
An if statement will execute a specified block of code only if the passed condition is true.

```
if (condition = true) {
  // do this
}
```

## If/Else statement
Just like an if statement, but it will execute the else block of code if the condition evaluates to false.

```
if (condition = true) {
  // run only if condition was true
} else {
  // run only if condition was false
}
```
